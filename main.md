AsciiDoc-Deck.js
================

I have wrote a tutorial-slide for illustration. You can check it out at [this page](./tutorial-slide.html). The source code of the tutorial-slide can be found [here](./tutorial-slide.asciidoc).

Writing Deck.js slides with AsciiDoc is very simple, I suggest you get start with [this template](./example-template.asciidoc).
